    <h1>Animals</h1>
    <p><b>Animals</b>(also called Metazoa) are <i>multicellular, eukaryotic</i> organisms in the biological kingdom <i>Animalia</i>. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and go through an ontogenetic stage in which their body consists of a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total.</p>

    <h3>Carnivores:</h3>
    <p>A carnivore is an organism that mostly eats meat, or the flesh of animals. Sometimes carnivores are called predators. Organisms that carnivores hunt are called prey. Carnivores are a major part of the food web, a description of which organisms eat which other organisms in the wild.</p>
